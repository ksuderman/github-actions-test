# Github Actions Test
Repository used to test GitHub actions

To test the `tag and release` action
1. Create a PR
1. Label the PR with one of:
   - `release`, `version`, `major` to bump the major version number
   - `enhancement`, `feature`, `minor` to bump the minor version number
   - `bug`, `values`, `patch` to bump the patch number
1. Merge the PR
   
**NOTE** In the future the labels will likely be reduced to `major`, `minor`, and `patch` so it is likely a good idea to just stick with those labels from the start.
